Chess against ai
This program was created for the final project at ItStep. The main game window is made using tkinter and has a minimalist style in the color scheme of chess.com. In the center of the screen is a large chessboard, and on the right is a control panel. The user selects the color of his side via the Play for White and Play for Black buttons with pawn icons. The timer automatically starts at the beginning of the game and displays the game time. At the bottom is a slider for choosing the AI ​​difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). In the upper corner is an exit button with a dynamic color change on hover
The AI ​​in my program uses an algorithm based on Minimax to choose the optimal moves.

Before installing, don't forget to download all modules pip install -r requirements.txt
